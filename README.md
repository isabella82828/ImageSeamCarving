# Image Seam Carving
This is an image seam carving tool that resizes an image without cropping out entire portions of an image or distorting it. This is accomplished through removing the minimum energy-level pixel seams. 

Unlike standard resizing techniques, including cropping and scaling, seam carving preserves the most interesting features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image.
