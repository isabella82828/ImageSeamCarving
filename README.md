# ImageSeamCarving
An image seam carving tool to resize an image without cropping out entire portions of an image or distorting it. This is accomplished through removing the minimum energy-level pixel seams. 

Unlike standard resizing techniques, including cropping and scaling, seam carving preserves the most interest features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image.
